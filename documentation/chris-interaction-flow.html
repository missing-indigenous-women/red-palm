<h1>Use-case and Interaction Flow</h1>
<p>Chris lives on the local reservation.  One day three months ago, his daughter, Marcy, age 17, went missing.  Chris contacted the tribal police and the local police department, but there are jurisdictional laws that prevent the reservation police, the local police, and the federal police to share information about Marcy's case.  After much frustration, Chris decides to put Marcy's information in Red Palm.</p>

<p><b>Precondition: </b>Chris has signed up for a Red Palm account, is logged into his account now, and is looking at the homepage now and wants to upload Marcy's profile.</p>
<p><b>Postcondition: </b>Chris successfully uploads Marcy's profile to Red Palm and now can watch the investigation as it unfolds (i.e. watch for new statuses on the case as they come in).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chris clicks on/goes to the Missing Person > Missing Person Information section of the website</li>
  <li>The Missing Person Information webpage brings up a webpage that has the option to Add New Person or Edit Person</li>
  <li>Chris clicks on Add New Person</li>
  <li>The website brings up a form where Chris can enter information about Marcy</li>
  <li>Chris begins by uploading a photo of Marcy.  Next, he fills out the text input fields for each of the information elements (e.g. name, age, weight, eye color, hair color, last seen date, last seen location, circumstances of disappearance.  Chris hits the submit button.</li>
  <li>The website takes Chris back to the landing page.</li>
</ul>
